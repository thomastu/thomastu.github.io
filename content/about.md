My name is Thomas Tu and this is my personal site where I sometimes post about my projects, thoughts and zettelkasten notes.  I also keep a slightly more up to date CV/resume [here](/resume).

# I am a(n)

Energy and climate geek.  Linux enthusiast.  Cat-owner.  Mediocre chess player with a crippling chess addiction.  Bay area native.

## and ...

I'm a software engineer by trade though I'd like to think I'm an energy professional first, and a developer second.  I've been neck deep in the world of demand side management (mostly energy efficiency) since 2014 from working at [Lawrence Berkeley Lab](https://ees.lbl.gov/) to advance and enforce national efficiency standards, to implementing utility level incentive programs and advocacy campaigns at my current employer, [Energy Solutions](https://energy-solution.com).  I'm a big believer that software has a critical role in society's ongoing struggle to decarbonise the world's energy systems.

## ... but also

like any average developer, I'm strongly opinionated about things I have no business having opinions in such as...

- WebOS was way ahead of its time and was the best mobile OS ever.
- ZuneHD was way ahead of its time and was the best music player ever.
- Why anyone would pick MacOS or Windows over Linux is just weird.
- Tech is probably over-valued as a sector.
- MMT is probably has it right and spending definitely precedes taxes.
- Denying universal healthcare and tuition-free post-secondary education is making life worse for everyone, and it's weird that these are contentious ideas.

I may write about these topics at time, but they represent nothing more than my hot takes from my little slice of perspective of the world.  I'd take them all with a grain of salt, and if I'm wrong (as I likely am about many things), I'd love to hear your thoughts!
