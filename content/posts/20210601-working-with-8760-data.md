## Background

Two major trends have emerged in the past decade which motivate changes in how energy efficiency and demand-side managers interact with and think about end-use energy consumption data.  First, there has been an explosion of high frequency network connected monitors in buildings and appliances.  This has unlocked the possibility of highly resolute and precise energy savings as seen in ventures such as [recurve](https://www.recurve.com/).  Second,  the nature of the gird is rapidly changing as intermittents begin to saturate supply at certain times of the day.  The concept of "net load" is quickly going away, and historically "good-enough" descriptors of emissions, energy savings opportunities, and energy costs need to be re-evaluated.  In both cases, this has given rise to the use of hourly or more more frequent data to model or estimate impacts from energy savings and impacts.
