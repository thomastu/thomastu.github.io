I'm a software developer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab primarily contributing to data collection efforts for studying appliance markets across the world.

I graduated from UC San Diego in 2014 with a dual degree in Mathematics and Physics.  I started working in the Energy Efficiency Standards group as an RA, but have since moved onto a software development role (largely under the guidance of Brian Gerke.)  I'd like to continue putting my skills toward producing good research for energy policy so I'm currently focused on applying to graduate programs in Stats with rigorous computational components.
