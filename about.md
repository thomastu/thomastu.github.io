I'm a software engineer at [Energy Solutions] working on various python/Django projects for efficiency programs around the country.  Up until early 2017, I was a software developer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in the [Energy Efficiency Standards][EES] group.  At LBNL, I primarly worked on IDEA (the International Database for Efficienct Appliances) and other internal tools which facilitated the data collection, management and analysis of online appliance markets.  Outside of development work on IDEA, I provided general technical support for Department of Energy's Appliance Standards Program.  I (recently) graduated in 2014 from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Physics, and a B.S. in Mathematics.
