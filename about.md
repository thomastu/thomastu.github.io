I'm currently a software developer at LBNL, working on data collection and management activities within the [Energy Efficiency Standards group](https://ees.lbl.gov/).  I graduated from UC San Diego in 2014 and started working at LBNL soon after as a research associate.  I was attracted to the idea of working on energy-related issues from my undergraduate work with Prof. Tom Murphy, doing basic data analysis for a few posts on [Do-the-math](http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/).  Shortly after (and under the guidance of Brian Gerke), I took an interest in software development and was reclassified as a software developer.  I work mostly with Django/Postgres/Python/Celery, but also have had to play the role of a small-scale linux admin.  I'm now interested in developing my software development skills as it relates to research support.
