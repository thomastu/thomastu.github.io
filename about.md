I'm a software developer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab working in the Energy Efficiency Standards group.  I graduated from UC San Diego in 2014 with a dual degree in Mathematics and Physics.  In the long term, I'm interested in applying software engineering skills in a research environment (so called "Research Software Engineering").  In the short term, I'd like to continue building software-based tools for research to help parse data in novel ways.
